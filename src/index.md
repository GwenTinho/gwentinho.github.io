Moien! I am a luxembourgish Master's student currently based in Paris. I work on Category Theory and Synthetic Mathematics.

Things that I like to babble about:
- Formal Category Theory (2-categories)
- (Categorical) Homotopy Theory i.e. Model categories & Higher Categories
- Type Theories and their semantics
- Foundations of mathematics
- Automata Theory
- Unreasonably Complicated Coffee making processes

## Stuff I did:

I did an [M1 project](https://gwentinho.github.io/files/report-rfsa.pdf) with [Daniela Petrisan](https://www.irif.fr/~petrisan/) about recovering residual finite state automata (RFSA) via the [functorial approach to automata](https://lmcs.episciences.org/6213), the ideas are what inspired the current internship.



## What I do right now

I am currently doing an M2 internship with [Jonas Frey](https://sites.google.com/site/jonasfreysite/) on Lax Idempotent monads. And I recently gave a talk about this at [LHC](https://smimram.gitlabpages.inria.fr/lhc/journees/2025/01/01/journees.html). Next week I will give a short talk on the same topic at [CT2025](https://conference.math.muni.cz/ct2025/)
