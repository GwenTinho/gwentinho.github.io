!! I changed my email to the LIPN one !!

Moien! I am a luxembourgish PhD student at [LIPN](https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/) based in Paris. I am supervised by [Jonas Frey](https://sites.google.com/site/jonasfreysite/), [Morgan Rogers](https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~rogers/index.html) and [Damiano Mazza](https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~mazza/).

Things that I like to babble about:
- Modal Type Theories mostly Real Cohesive Type Theory
- Formal Category Theory
- Higher Category Theory
- Foundations of Mathematics
- Automata Theory
- The Science of Logic
- Unreasonably Complicated Coffee making processes

## Stuff I did:

I did an [M1 project](https://gwentinho.github.io/files/report-rfsa.pdf) with [Daniela Petrisan](https://www.irif.fr/~petrisan/) about recovering residual finite state automata (RFSA) via the [functorial approach to automata](https://lmcs.episciences.org/6213), the ideas are what inspired the current internship.

I finished my [M2 internship](https://gwentinho.github.io/files/report-mnemetic.pdf) with Jonas Frey on lax-idempotent monads. The idea here was to understand what it means to be a generator with respect to a cocompletion, for example finitely presented objects come together with the Ind-completion. And use this to recover results such as Gabriel-Ulmer Duality and Priestley Duality.
