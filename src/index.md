Moien! I am a luxembourgish Master's student currently based in Paris. I work on Category Theory and Synthetic Mathematics.

Things that I like to babble about:
- Formal Category Theory (2-categories)
- (Categorical) Homotopy Theory i.e. Model categories & Higher Categories
- Type Theories and their semantics
- Foundations of mathematics
- Unreasonably Complicated Coffee making processes

I am currently doing an M2 internship with Jonas Frey on Lax Idempotent monads.
