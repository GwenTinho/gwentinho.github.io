Moien! I am a luxembourgish Master's student currently based in Paris. I work on Category Theory and Synthetic Mathematics.

Things that I like to babble about:
- Formal Category Theory (2-categories)
- (Categorical) Homotopy Theory i.e. Model categories & Higher Categories
- Type Theories and their semantics
- Foundations of mathematics
- Automata Theory
- Unreasonably Complicated Coffee making processes

## Stuff I did:

I did an [M1 project](https://gwentinho.github.io/files/report-rfsa.pdf) with [Daniela Petrisan](https://www.irif.fr/~petrisan/) about recovering residual finite state automata (RFSA) via the [functorial approach to automata](https://lmcs.episciences.org/6213), the ideas are what inspired the current internship.

I finished my [M2 internship](https://gwentinho.github.io/files/report-mnemetic.pdf) with Jonas Frey on lax-idempotent monads. The idea here was to understand what it means to be a generator with respect to a cocompletion. And use this to recover certain dualities from categorical logic and Stone duality.

## What I do right now

I will start my PhD in October at [LIPN](https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/) with [Jonas Frey](https://sites.google.com/site/jonasfreysite/), [Morgan Rogers](https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~rogers/index.html) and [Damiano Mazza](https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~mazza/) on connecting Differential Cohesion and Differential Linear Logic.
